# Ardunio-Organ-Pedal
Organ Pedalboard using the Arduino Microprocessor.

TL;DR Buying a pre-built organ pedalboard is expensive and most don't do exactly what I want. 
Other projects I've seen use old organ pedalboards and old analog parts. I wanted to do something that's
mostly, if not completely, digital.
